      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 quart of cream</li>
        <li>1 wineglassful of curaçao</li>
        <li>1/2 pound of sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoonfuls of orange blossoms water</li>
        <li>Juice of two oranges</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Preparation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Put the sugar and half the cream over the fire in a double boiler.
          When the sugar is dissolved, take it from the fire, and let it cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          When cold, add the curaçao, orange juice and orange blossoms water,
          and the remaining cream.
        </li>
        <li>Freeze.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Instructions for freezing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <dl>
            <dt>Needed equipment</dt>
            <dd>
              <ul>
                <li>4-quart freezer 10 lb ice</li>
                <li>3 pints coarse</li>
                <li>rock salt</li>
              </ul>
            </dd>
          </dl>
        </li>
        <li>
          Before beginning to pack the freezer, turn the crank to see that all
          the machinery is in working order.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pound the ice in a large bag with a mallet, or use an ordinary ice
          shaver. The finer the ice, the less time it takes to freeze the cream.
          You may pack the freezer with a layer of ice three inches thick, then
          a layer of salt one inch thick, or mix the ice and salt in the tub and
          shovel it around the freezer. Open the can and turn in the mixture
          that is to be frozen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn the crank slowly and steadily until the mixture begins to freeze,
          then more rapidly until it is completely frozen.
        </li>
      </ul>

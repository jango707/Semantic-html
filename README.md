# Semantic html

Playing around with some more advanced html and css features

## What I learnt

- in ordered lists you can `reverse` the direction
- in ordered lists you can use `start=''`
- in ordered lists you can use `type=''`

- use `*, *::before, *::after { box-sizing: border-box; }`

- direct child selectors `.hello > h1 {`
- general sibling selector `.hello li ~ li {`
  - matches the element if a sibling is found before the element
- adjacent sibling selector `.hello li + li {`

- use `[]` to match attributes

- you can add text via CSS in using `:: after{ content: ''}` (MINDBLOWN)
